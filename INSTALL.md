# Requirements

* A web server such as nginx or apache2 with rewriteEngine module enabled. Note that we had problems configuring Nginx so you might need to debug the autogenerated config file.
* php7
* mysql or mariadb.
* Composer (php package manager). [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)
* a web browser.

# Installation procedure
  * Download this package from gitlab to your server.
  * Navigate to the current directory and do ``composer install --no-dev``
  * Create virtualhosts in your web server configuration e.g. ``http://mynode`` with the current directory as the documentRoot
  * Similarly put 2 more subdomain virtualhosts ``http://accounts.mynode`` and ``http://blogicService.mynode``. The blogic service adds transaction fees and is optional. Don't forget to restart your web server.
  * Ensure your web server can write files nodes.ini, error_log, AccountStore/accountstore.ini, AccountStore/store.json
  * Add the following line to /etc/hosts: ``127.0.0.1 mynode accounts.mynode blogic.mynode`` replacing mynode for your virtualhost name.
  * In your browser go to ``http://mynode/setup`` and enter the db credentials.
  * On submission you will be directed to the AccountStore config where you can add to the default three accounts.
  * (optional) If you want business logic, then configure by editing BlogicService/blogic.ini by hand.
  * (optional) Modify AccountStore/.htaccess and BlogicService/.htaccess setup/.htaccess to restrict access to your IP address. @todo couldn't all this be done from one .htaccess file? @todo how would this be done with nginx?
You should now be ready to start sending REST queries to the node. Consider using the [developer client](http://github.com/matslats/cc-client) for this.

# Setup for local development
  * Run composer as above but without the ``--no-dev`` flag. This will include the packages needed for testing.
  * The openapi spec is at vendor/matslats/cc-php-lib/docs/credit-commons-openapi-3.0.yml
  * Once unittest is installed a standard battery of tests can be run the current directory, in which inputs and outputs are compared against the openapi spec. From the current directory, do ``vendor/bin/phpunit tests/APITest.php``
  * The [developer client](http://github.com/matslats/cc-client) is a UI for all the API calls and responses. Install seperately its own apache node.
