# Requirements

* A web server such as nginx or apache2 with rewriteEngine module enabled. Note that we had problems configuring Nginx so you might need to debug the autogenerated config file.
* At least php 7.0
* Mysql or mariadb.
* Composer (php package manager). [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)
* A web browser (to use the crude config interface)
* A client application which supports the credit commons API. eg the [developer client](http://github.com/matslats/cc-client)

# Installation procedure

  * Download this package from gitlab to your server.
  * Navigate to the current directory and do ``composer install --no-dev``
  * Create 3 virtualhosts in your web server configuration as indicated in the section below. The blogic service adds transaction fees and is optional. Don't forget to restart your web server.
  * Ensure your web server can write files nodes.ini, error_log, AccountStore/accountstore.ini, AccountStore/store.json
  * Add the following line to /etc/hosts: ``127.0.0.1 myccnode accounts.myccnode blogic.myccnode`` replacing myccnode for your virtualhost name.
  * In your browser go to ``http://myccnode/config`` and enter the db credentials.
  * On submission you will be directed to the AccountStore config where you can add to the default three accounts.
  * (optional) If you want business logic, then configure by editing BlogicService/blogic.ini by hand.
  * (optional) Modify AccountStore/.htaccess and BlogicService/.htaccess config/.htaccess to restrict access to your IP address. @todo couldn't all this be done from one .htaccess file? @todo how would this be done with nginx?

# Setup for local development

  * Run composer as above but without the ``--no-dev`` flag. This will include the packages needed for testing.
  * The OpenApi spec is at vendor/matslats/cc-php-lib/docs/credit-commons-openapi-3.0.yml
  * unittest compares inputs and outputs against the (local) Openapi spec. To run the battery of tests, from the node root ,do ``vendor/bin/phpunit tests/APITest.php``

#minimal settings for virtualhosts in apache

``<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName myccnode
  DocumentRoot /home/matslats/localhost/cc-node
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName blogic.myccnode
  DocumentRoot /home/matslats/localhost/cc-node/BlogicService
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName accounts.myccnode
  DocumentRoot /home/matslats/localhost/cc-node/AccountStore
</VirtualHost>``
Each of these documentRoots must have the .htaccess file provided, as must myccnode/config
