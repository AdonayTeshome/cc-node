# Requirements

* A web server such as nginx or apache2 with rewriteEngine module enabled. Note that we had problems configuring Nginx so you might need to debug the autogenerated config file.
* php7
* mysql or mariadb.
* a web browser.


# Installation procedure 
Assuming this package has already been downloaded from github to your server:

  * Composer is required. [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)
  * From the current directory, run ``composer install --no-dev``
  * Create 3 virtualhosts in your web server configuration e.g. http://mynode with the current directory as the document root, and http://acc ounts.mynode and http://blogicService.mynode. Restart your web server.
  * Add the following to /etc/hosts: ``127.0.0.1 mynode accounts.mynode blogic.mynode``
  * Fill in the form at http://mynode/setup.
  * On submission you will be directed to the AccountStore config to create at least 2 accounts.
  * Modify AccountStore/.htaccess and BlogicService/.htaccess setup/.htaccess to restrict access to your IP address. @todo couldn't all this be done from one file? @todo how would this be done with nginx?
  * Make sure that apache can write to your directory if you want to keep the server log there.

# For local development
  * Run composer as above but without the ``--no-dev`` flag. This will include the packages needed for testing.
  * The openapi spec is at vendor/matslats/cc-php-lib/docs/credit-commons-openapi-3.0.yml
  * Once unittest is installed a standard battery of tests can be run the current directory, in which inputs and outputs are compared against the openapi spec. From the current directory, do ``vendor/bin/phpunit tests/APITest.php``
  * The [developer client](http://github.com/matslats/cc-client) is a UI for all the API calls and responses. Install seperately its own apache node.
